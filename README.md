# obsidian_music
Personal project. Git repository synchronized with obsidian submodule to take up-to-date music list and display it on website in a random order while automatically skipping ads.

Maybe create different music options, such as recreational, engaged study or focused study.

## Steps to create
1. Create a repo that is linked to a synced submodule of the Obsidian repo.
2. Create a webpage that displays a random music video from obsidianâ€™s music list consisting of links to music videos.
3. Also have the ability to skip adds automatically.
