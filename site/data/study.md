# Music for studying or working
For studying/working, the best music contains no text, instruments increase arousal which can help with motivation to study and the lack of text prevents or limits distractions. Music can also hide external distracting noises.
For difficult work dark noise may be best by being the least distracting but when work is less difficult beats may provide more motivation to work for longer.
#### Less engaging music is better for deep focus
