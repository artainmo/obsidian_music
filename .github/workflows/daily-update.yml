    steps:
      # Step 1: Download the GitHub repositoryâ€™s source code to the runner (the virtual machine where the action is being executed). Without this step, the subsequent steps wouldn't have access to the repository's code.
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Run 'make update' to update the obsidian repository and push.
